# Hangman game 

It is a classic word-guessing game where the player attempts to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of guesses.

- Each incorrect guess results in a part of a stick figure being drawn, representing a "hangman."

- The player wins by correctly guessing the word before the hangman drawing is completed.                                                             ## Run the code 

**Note:** install python before running the script by using this command: 

```sh
pkg install python
```

```sh
git clone https://github.com/EliezerSunny/Hangman-game.git
```

```sh
cd Hangman-game
```

```sh
python Hangman.py
```

Enjoy your game!!! ðŸ¤—
