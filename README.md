# Hangman game 

It is a classic word-guessing game where the player attempts to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of guesses.

- Each incorrect guess results in a part of a stick figure being drawn, representing a "hangman."

- The player wins by correctly guessing the word before the hangman drawing is completed.                                                             ## Run the code 

**Note:** install python before running the script by using this command: 

```pkg install python

git clone https://github.com/EliezerSunny/Hangman-game.git 

cd Hangman-game

python Hangman.py```

Enjoy your game!!! ðŸ¤—
